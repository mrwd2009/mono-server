# Overview
This project is created to store reusable components and some interesting things I want to do.

Those reusable components probably can't be used directly. But we can change them with a little efforts.

Node version should be larger than v14.15.1

## Available Scripts

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:4101](http://localhost:4101) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

Other commands are same with ones in create react app.
